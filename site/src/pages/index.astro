        <h2>How to play</h2>
        <p>
          This word game challenges players to create words on a grid-based
          board, scoring points based on letter values and special board spaces.
        </p>
        <h3>Game Setup</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The game is played on a grid.</li>
          <li>Each player is given tiles to begin.</li>
          <li>Players take turns placing words on the board.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The first word must cover the center space.</li>
          <li>
            Subsequent words must connect to or intersect with existing words on
            the board.
          </li>
          <li>
            Words can be placed horizontally (left to right) or vertically (top
            to bottom).
          </li>
          <li>
            All words formed during a turn must be deemed valid by the other
            players.
          </li>
          <li>
            After playing a word, new tiles will be given to replace those used.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Scoring</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Each letter has a point value.</li>
          <li>
            Special board spaces can multiply letter or word scores:
            <ul>
              <li>Double Letter Score (DL)</li>
              <li>Triple Letter Score (TL)</li>
              <li>Double Word Score (DW)</li>
              <li>Triple Word Score (TW)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Score all words formed or modified during your turn.</li>
          <li>
            The main word score is calculated first, then any additional words
            formed.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Indirect Word Formation</h3>
        <p>
          When you place a word, you may form additional words perpendicular to
          your main word. These "indirect" words are also scored and must be
          valid. For example:
        </p>
        <Board
          width={7 * 50}
          height={2 * 50}
          cellSize={50}
          grid={{
            "0,0": "H",
            "1,0": "E",
            "2,0": "L",
            "3,0": "L",
            "4,0": "O",
            "4,1": "W",
            "5,1": "O",
            "6,1": "W",
          }}
          offsetX={0}
          offsetY={0}
          allowPanning={true}
        />
        <p>
          In this example, playing "WOW" horizontally not only scores for "WOW"
          but also creates and scores the vertical word "OW".
        </p>
        <h3>Ending the Game</h3>
        <p>
          The game ends when:
          <ul>
            <li>
              All tiles have been drawn and one player uses all their tiles, or
            </li>
            <li>No more valid plays can be made</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Winning</h3>
        <p>
          The player with the highest total score at the end of the game wins.
